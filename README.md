# Angular-TaskManagementSystem
Build a task management application using Angular (15v) framework that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks.

Requirements:
1. User Interface:
   Create a clean and intuitive user interface.
   Interface has to be responsive.
   Include components for displaying tasks, adding tasks, editing tasks, and deleting tasks.
   Use Angular Material for UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.).

2. Functionality:
    Display a list of tasks with their titles, descriptions, due dates, and statuses (e.g., pending, completed).
    Implement functionality to add new tasks with a title, description, due date, and status.
    Allow users to edit existing tasks (title, description, due date, status).
    Enable users to mark tasks as completed or delete tasks.
    Implement basic validation for task inputs (e.g., required fields, valid due date).

3. State Management:
    Utilize Angular's built-in services for managing application state.
    Ensure proper separation of concerns by using services for business logic and data management.

4. Routing:
    Implement routing to navigate between different views (e.g., task list, add task, edit task).

5. Persistence:
    Store task data locally using Angular's HttpClient module and a mock backend or localStorage.
    Ensure that task data persists between page reloads.

6. Testing:
    Write unit tests for critical components, services, and functionality using Jasmine and Karma.
    Aim for good test coverage to ensure application reliability.

- Implement user authentication and authorization.
- Add sorting and filtering functionality for tasks.
- Implement drag-and-drop functionality for reordering tasks.
- Include error handling for HTTP requests and user inputs.
- Add animations to enhance user experience.
